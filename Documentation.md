# **Syllabus Reader App**

## **Purpose and Goals**

The main purpose of this application is to provide ease for students and faculty with time management. A lot of students at Whitworth University complain that they have to repeatedly download the syllabus to check when their reading assignments that are due, and when their midterms are. This sparked our interest and we thought about an application that reads your syllabus and formats all the deadlines and exam dates with their respective title. Moreover, the application feeds in the formatted data into a calender that is synced to Whitworth student's Outlook account. Students will be able to upload multiple syllabi. If there are two deadlines on one day, the deadlines will be able to overlap.

This will prevent students from manually organizing their Schedule, and it will save students a lot of time. Some Students have to physically write everything done to organize their schedule, but with this, they'll be able to digitalize everything.

## **Users and Clients**

The main users of this application will be the students themselves. The students may need to log in to verify that they are a student, and to connect their outlook calender with the application. After they have logged in, they can upload their syllabus, and then their calender will get updated.

On the other hand, the application will have professors who will need to have a Whitworth account. Professors will be able to upload their schedules, their advisee meetings and class times. They will get reminded by their calender.

## **Device and System Requirements to Run the Application**

1. Ensure you have Windows installed on your machine (Preferably a Computer).

2. Install a web browser of your own choice, it can be Chrome, Edge or Firefox

3. Ensure you have your Syllabus in PDF form. Make sure your file does not have any sensitive information.

4. In order to develop the application and access the database, you will need mySQL, and potentially python flask environment. However, we have not thought about that aspect yet.
