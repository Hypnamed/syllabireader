## READING: 30Weeks Section 3.3, Tutorials on Your Language
## EXERCISES:

**EX04_01** – Pick one small piece of functionality from EX03, and implement it.

**EX04_02** – Johnston 308 (and Johnston 214) are good physical places for designing and developing darn-near anything, but they are certainly not perfect. What are some changes you would make to this space? Give good explanations for each of these – you're trying to convince the company president (me) that we should spend the money to make these improvements.

**EX04_03** – Reflect on your progress so far. What skills have you learned? What skills do you need to learn still? What failures have you run into? How have you responded to those failures? What successes have you had?
