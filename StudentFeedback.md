# **Critical Feedback**

## **After Pitching the Idea to five other students, we got the following thoughts and concerns**

The people we interviewed were mostly students, as me and Eren usually hang out in a studying area.

After pitching the Idea, all of the students thought that it was a great idea and it would make their life much more easier. They will not have to download the syllabus again and again, and this will not fill up their downloads folder.

- Charis, an international student from Phillipines said that it is very exhausting to set up their schedule, and it takes them way too long.

- One question we got from Michelle was that, what will we do if a professor makes a change to the syllabus. What if he changes a deadline, does that overlap our calender? Or do you have remake all of your calender again?

- Julius, another student asked what database we are going to use, and how are we going to store the data into the application. We initially thought about MySQL because of the familiarity, but we may also use NoSQL as we do not have much experience with it.

- Adam suggested that the calender should automatically be updated when the professor makes any change to the syllabus. However, we thought that it would be very complicated because the app will have to connect the professor with the students and then overwrite the student calender. Students should have total power over their calender.

- Another concern was about the way the application is going to read the syllabus. What if it makes a slight mistake? Is it reliable? How is the app going to parse the pdf file?. We initially thought about using AI to format the data and then we were going to upload that data to Outlook Calender API, but this is just a thought.

- Students said that this is an app that they would use only about once or twice a semester. They will likely use it all togther, Which means that there will be a lot of traffic and we would need to accomodate that many people.
